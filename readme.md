here is a very special read me, oh so near and dear to my heart!


to-do list:
- need to in genki call:
    - add in inclusive flag - boolean
    - figure out how to differentiate between verbs and adjectives
    - right now we have results working but it would be great to have a separate section for adjectives / verbs rather than as one bulk unit

- add in more data to csv 
- export functions into separate file, it's a weebit busy right now

- build out the build your own functionality
- build out the jlpt calls 


- figure out how to differentiate between kanji and hiragana
